# Rental price by time unit

Change the behavior of rental_pricelist so that it makes discounts for the number of
days and not for the number of days multiplied by the units, in contexts in which large
quantities are rented and the aim is to encourage long-term rentals, so important is
only the duration of the rental and not the units.
